            " pseudonym \"Heisenberg\", was a chemist and a former chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, "+
            "New Mexico, who, after being diagnosed with Stage 3A inoperable lung cancer, "+
            "started manufacturing crystal methamphetamine to both pay for his treatments and "+

            "and is portrayed as a protagonist, antagonist and antihero.",
    "Jesse Bruce Pinkman is the deuteragonist of Breaking Bad. He is the former partner of Walter White in the methamphetamine drug trade. Jesse was a small-time methamphetamine user, manufacturer, and dealer. He was also an inattentive student in Walter White's chemistry class, leading to his dropping out. In his mid-20s, Jesse became Walt's business partner in the meth trade. Before his partnership with Walt, he, operating under the pseudonym \"Cap'n Cook\", added a little Chili Powder to make his methamphetamine stand out in the market.",
    "James \"Jimmy\" Morgan McGill, known by his professional alias Saul Goodman, is a former criminal lawyer and the former principal attorney of Saul Goodman & Associates. He operated out of a cheap strip mall office and ran over-the-top late night TV ads advising potential clients they'd \"Better Call Saul!\" when in trouble with the law, promising \"I fight for YOU, Albuquerque!\" While his late-night commercial ads seemed tacky and cheap, Saul was an incredibly effective lawyer, using illegal tactics and dirty schemes to make sure his clients came out on top.",
    "Henry R. \"Hank\" Schrader was the husband of Marie Schrader (the sister of Skyler White) and Assistant Special Agent in Charge (ASAC) of the Albuquerque office of the Drug Enforcement Administration. A high-energy and boisterous man, Hank was Walter White's brother-in-law.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Although he was a highly competent agent and seemed to genuinely care about Marie, Walter, Skyler White and Walter White Jr., his loud and loutish machismo insulated him from the danger he faced daily.",
    "Skyler White (née Lambert) is the wife of Walter White. Skyler and Walter have a teenage son, Walter White Jr., and an infant daughter, Holly White. Skyler cares for Walter very much, but their marriage becomes increasingly strained due to his unexplained absences and bizarre behavior, ultimately leading to their separation.\n" +
            "Later, once Walter reveals his involvement in the meth business, she initially seeks a divorce but ultimately ends up aiding him in laundering his illicit funds. At Skyler's behest, the Whites eventually procure the A1A Car Wash that Walter once had to work at. As Walter slowly becomes more of a \"hardened criminal,\" she becomes increasingly frightened for her and her children's safety, attempting to get Walt Jr. and Holly as far away from their father as possible. Skyler's sister, Marie Schrader, was married to Hank Schrader, an agent with the DEA, until he met his untimely death at the hands of Jack Welker, the leader of a group of White Supremacists.",
    "Michael \"Mike\" Ehrmantraut was a former crooked Philadelphia police officer who worked as the Head of Corporate Security at Los Pollos Hermanos, hit man, consigliere, enforcer and second-in-command in Gustavo Fring's crystal meth operation. On occasion, he served Saul Goodman as a private investigator, cleaner, and fixer. He is the secondary antagonist of Season 4 and the main antagonist for the first half of Season 5. Prior to his involvement in Gus's operation, Mike worked as parking ticket booth operator at a local courthouse, where he met Saul, then known as Jimmy McGill.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As a former beat cop and true professional, he maintained an extensive, up-to-date knowledge of forensic evidence, surveillance equipment, and police procedure. Mike was also well trained and cool in all types of combat situations, once using science and long strategy to take down a large number of hostiles sans fuss. A rough and rocky relationship between Jesse Pinkman and Mike began, and although initially being frustrated at being assigned to Jesse by Gus, he learned to like him after Jesse begins to show potential. However, Mike did not like Walt in the least, considering him to be selfish, arrogant, and egotistical. ",
    "Gustavo \"Gus\" Fring was a Chilean-born Albuquerque restaurateur, business magnate, and philanthropist. He was the respected proprietor of Los Pollos Hermanos, a highly successful fried chicken restaurant chain. He was also a public booster for the local DEA office. However, despite outward appearances, Gus was a major drug kingpin initially affiliated with the Mexican Juárez Cartel, secretly using his restaurant as a legitimate cover for methamphetamine distribution throughout the American southwest. Like Walter White, Gus was a criminal who \"hid in plain sight\", using his anti-drug philanthropy to conceal his true nature and build his illicit drug empire step by step.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "When Walt seeks a buyer for his chemically pure meth, he is put in contact with Gus. Walt manages to persuade Gus into purchasing thirty-eight pounds of his meth for $1.2 million; after the product yields good returns, Gus offers Walt $3 million for three months of his time. Gus' hiring and protection of Walt puts him at odds with the cartel's leadership. Despite Gus' initial protection of Walt during the second and third seasons, the collaboration between the two men becomes continuously strained, and Gus becomes a formidable adversary of Walt's and the main antagonist during the fourth season.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Despite being one step ahead of Walter at every turn and predicting every one of Walt's attempts to kill him, Gus did have one weakness - his unbridled hatred for Hector \"Tio\" Salamanca, a weakness that Walt discovered and ultimately exploited. To this end, Gus was killed in the Casa Tranquila explosion in which Walter convinced Hector to essentially suicide bomb Gus.",
    "Brandon Mayhew, commonly referred to as Badger, is one of Jesse Pinkman's longtime friends. Despite his probation, Badger continues to use drugs recreationally. Badger, as a condition of his probation stipulating that he find and maintain employment, is working as a walking billboard, wearing a full-body dollar bill costume for a realty company. When he runs into Jesse, the two teamed up briefly to cook meth by using the money from Badger's job to buy pseudophedrine. However, Jesse disposed of inferior batches several times, angering Badger. This escalated to a scuffle which resulted in Jesse kicking Badger out of his RV. Badger shoots a crossbow bolt at the RV after the two scuffle over a batch of meth and Jesse drives off,  leaving him stranded in the desert"};
